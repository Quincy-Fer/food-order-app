**Created A Food-Ordering App**

Following instructions from Maximilian Schwarzmuller I created a food ordering app

This simple app allows you to add food orders to a cart and allows you to order the food entering your data in a form.

The app allowed me to familiarize myself more with: 
1.REST API's and https request
2. Context API to create a global store: allowing CART interactions and Modal forms. 
3. Custom Hooks
4. Hooks such as useContext, useCallBack, useActionState, useEffect etc.
5. React 19 Form features
